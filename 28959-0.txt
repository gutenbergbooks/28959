MONT ST MICHEL FROM THE CAUSEWAY
ON THE ROAD BETWEEN CONCHES AND BEAUMONT-LE-ROGER This is typical of the
poplar-bordered roads of Normandy.

THE CHATEAU GAILLARD FROM THE ROAD BY THE SEINE The village of Le Petit
Andely appears below the castle rock, and is partly hidden by the
island. The chalk cliffs on the left often look like ruined walls.

A TYPICAL REACH OF THE SEINE BETWEEN ROUEN AND LE PETIT ANDELY On one
side great chalk cliffs rise precipitously, and on the other are broad
flat pastures.

THE CHURCH AT GISORS, SEEN FROM THE WALLS OF THE NORMAN CASTLE

THE TOUR DE LA GROSSE HORLOGE, ROUEN It is the Belfry of the City, and
was commenced in 1389.

THE CATHEDRAL AT ROUEN Showing a peep of the Portail de la Calende, and
some of the quaint houses of the oldest part of the City.

THE CATHEDRAL OF EVREUX SEEN FROM ABOVE On the right, just where the
light touches some of the roofs of the houses, the fine old belfry can
be seen.

A TYPICAL FARMYARD SCENE IN NORMANDY The curious little thatched
mushroom above the cart is to be found in most of the Norman farms.

THE BRIDGE AT BEAUMONT-LE-ROGER On the steep hill beyond stands the
ruined abbey church.

IN THE RUE AUX FEVRES, LISIEUX The second tiled gable from the left
belongs to the fine sixteenth century house called the Manoir de
Francois I.

THE CHURCH OF ST JACQUES AT LISIEUX One of the quaint umber fronted
houses for which the town is famous appears on the left.

FALAISE CASTLE The favourite stronghold of William the Conqueror.

THE PORTE DES CORDELIERS AT FALAISE A thirteenth century gateway that
overlooks the steep valley of the Ante.

THE CHATEAU D'O A seventeenth century manor house surrounded by a wide
moat.

THE GREAT VIEW OVER THE FORESTS TO THE SOUTH FROM THE RAMPARTS OF
DOMFRONT CASTLE Down below can be seen the river Varennes, and to the
left of the railway the little Norman Church of Notre-Dame-sur-l'Eau.

THE CLOCK GATE, VIRE

A VIEW OF MONT ST MICHEL AND THE BAY OF CANCALE FROM THE JARDIN DES
PLANTES AT AVRANCHES On the left is the low coast-line of Normandy, and
on the right appears the islet of Tombelaine.

THE LONG MAIN STREET OF COUTANCES In the foreground is the Church of St
Pierre, and in the distance is the Cathedral.

THE GREAT WESTERN TOWERS OF THE CHURCH OF NOTRE DAME AT ST LO They are
of different dates, and differ in the arcading and other ornament.

THE NORMAN TOWERS OF BAYEUX CATHEDRAL

OUISTREHAM


LIST OF LINE ILLUSTRATIONS

THE CHATELET AND LA MERVEILLE AT MONT ST MICHEL The dark opening through

Jourdain's great work.

THE PURPOSE OF THE FOOTNOTES

Having always considered footnotes an objectionable feature, I have
resorted to them solely for reference purposes. Therefore, the reader
who does not wish to look up my authorities need not take the slightest
notice of the references to the footnotes, which in no case contain
additional facts, but merely indications of the sources of information.
